PCB design of stackable controllers for blimps

Each stack contains a specified function for controlling a blimp

# Stacks
Below is the description of each stack

## RPi Stack
This stack takes care of the vision system for the blimp. The hardware integrates a Raspberry Pi CM4 with a Google Coral Accelerator Module. This combination will connect to upto 3 external cameras and process the image information. The system can implement machine vision algorithms like YOLO to process the scene and extract relevent information. 

## Actuation Stack

## Realtime Stack

## Sensing Stack

## Communication Stack
